# Python-Encyption
A simple python script for encrypting a string or a file with the use of the string

charas='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \#[]-=+ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890./,()'.

Every string is converted to an encrypted string according to the position of the character in the charas string
for example the string 'salsa' converts to '18011180'.
The same logic goes if the input is a .txt file .
For the decryption of the string/file we use the p[]/key[](the key of the encryption) to decrypt the input to its original
form!

In the text1.txt we have a .txt file for encyption.
The encryptedfile.txt is the encryption of the text1 and the decryptedfile.txt is the decryption of 
the input file.
